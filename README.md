Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is application of engineering principles, tools and methods to design, develop and maintain workable, efficient and reliable software systems. software engineering is important to the technology industry because it enables the creation of software applications & systems that power various aspects of life like communication, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a. The development of programming languages that focused on improving code readability and reducing errors through structured design techniques.
b. The advent of structured programming. With languages like C++ and Java, software development shifted towards encapsulating data and behavior within objects.
c. Rise of agile methodologies revolutionized software development, focusing on iterative development, flexibility, and customer collaboration over rigid processes.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-gathering the users needs and system requirements
Design-creating a detailed design of the software framework and interface
Impelementation-writing sode and building the software, meeting the desired quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment-Releasing the software to users
Maintenance-Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies are characterized by its sequential approach with distinct phases like requirements, design and implementation. An example where it would be appropriate would be projects with clear and unchanging requirements such as government contracts.
Agile methodologies are characterized by their iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and response to change. Such a methodology would be suitable for mobile apps since they will always updates to match the fast-changing technology.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer-They are responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer-They ensure the quality of the software by designing and excuting test plans
Project Manager-They oversee the planning, executing and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)-Are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code ( Visual Studio)
Version Control Systems (VCS): Are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members ( Git)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Technical Debt-Accumulating poor code practices over time. It can be ovecome by regular refactoring, writing unit tests, and reviewing code.
Scope Creep-Uncontrolled changes in project scope. It can be ovecome by implementing strong change management processes and clear communication with stakeholders.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing-Tests individual components of software
Integration testing-Tests interactions between the components of the software
System Testing-Tests the entire software
Acceptance Testing-Tests the software against user requirements to ensure it meets the users needs.
Testing is important in Software quality assurance because it helps detect and fix defects early on, thus leading to better software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting questions to obtain accurate, relevant and meaningful responses from AI models. It is important in that they are crucial in maximizing the utility of AI models to give accurate responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: "Tell me about music"
Improved prompt: "What key types of music genres in music and how are they different from one another"
The improved prompt is more specific on the musical genres and asks for detailed information, focusing the AI's reponse and making it more relevant to the user's needs.
